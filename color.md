## Image Colorization

**Project description:** In this project, we are implementing a convolutional neural network that takes a grey scale image as its input and generates colors for it. The project was inspired by a paper from Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola and Alexei A. Efros (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511), who were able to produce vibrant and realistic colorizations for grey scale images.

### 1. The Set-Up

This work is realized as a final project for the class "Implementing artificial neural networks with tensorflor" at Osnabr√ºck University. In a team of three, we are currently working on reproducing the results from Richard Zhang and colleagues with our own implementation. The project will be finished by April 19th.

### 2. The Results

As the project is not finished at the time being, please visit the github repository to find the final results from May 2020 onwards.

### 3. Personal Summary

During the project I was able to deepen my theoretical and practical understanding of artificial neural networks. By implementing our own convolutional neural network and experimenting with it, I was able to enhance my programming skills further and practice my research skills in the field of machine learning.
