## Image Colorization

**Project description:** This work was realized as a final project for the class "Implementing artificial neural networks with tensorflor" at Osnabr√ºck University.
We are implementing a convolutional neural network that takes a grey scale image as its input and generates colors for it. The project was inspired by a paper from Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola and Alexei A. Efros (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511), who were able to produce vibrant and realistic colorizations for grey scale images.
