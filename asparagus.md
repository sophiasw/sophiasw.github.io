## Automatic Asparagus Classification

**Project description:** An essential step in commercial asparagus cultivation is the sorting of the harvested stalks into different commercial classes. Depending on size, shape and colour, the individual spears are assigned to a quality class which determines the price of the spears. Nowadays, this task is usally done automatically, with modern asparagus sorting machines achieving a throughput of up to eight spears per second. However, the accuracy of such machines is often unreliable, making manual resorting unavoidable, causing non-negligible costs.

The study project is investigating how techniques from computer vision, both classical and deep learning based, can be applied to this task to improve classification results. The project is supported by a local asparagus farm, providing training data and allowing to evaluate the proposed solutions in a real environment.

### 1. The Set-Up

The project was realized in the context of a study project at Osnabr√ºck University. To complete the cognitive science master's degree students have to participate in a study project for one year. As my brother runs an asparagus farm, I was able to combine helping my family and researching on an interesting topic. In a group of seven motivated students and two supervisors we started the project in April 2019 and finished it in May 2020. 


### 2. The Process

In the course of the project we implemented algorithms that automatically detect several features from images of asparagus. Those features can be used to classify the asparagus into commercial classes. Further, we experimented with numerous machine learning approaches such as variational autoencoders, principal component analysis, convolutional neural networks, multi layer perceptrons and random forests. 

### 3. The Results

We were able to implement and test a variety of machine learning algorithms in the context of automatic asparagus classification. For a full report on the project and its results please visit our github repository (https://github.com/CogSciUOS/asparagus).

### 4. Personal Summary

During the project I was not only able to deepen my programming skills in machine learning and computer vision, I also learned a lot about soft skills like setting realistic goals, structuring a team, distributing tasks, giving and incorporating constructive feedback and working with git and asana.
